# Debit & Credit 5.3: Calendar Integration, New Cryptocurrencies

### Scheduled Transactions in Your Calendar
Sometimes it can be useful to look at your calendar and see your upcoming bill payments there. Now you can do that, just enable the “Include Into Calendar” option for a scheduled transaction.<br/><br/>

Behind the scenes, the app will create a local calendar in the Apple Calendar app and a new event will be added there. Please note that the calendar does not sync by itself with other devices, so to use this feature you need to have the app installed and running on every device.<br/><br/>

Please note that the app calendar is reserved for the app. You are not supposed to add new events to it or make changes to the existing events.

### New Cryptocurrencies

Over the last few months, I have received a number of requests to add support for extra cryptocurrencies. The following currencies are now available in the app: Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Stellar, Monero. You can also select gold (XAU) or silver (XAG) as a currency now.
Before using one of those new currencies, please make sure to update the app to version 5.3 on all of your devices.
